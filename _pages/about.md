# üôã About me

I am an incoming Ph.D. student who will pursue a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in Electrical Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://www.jhu.edu/). I work at [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Najim Dehak](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/najim-dehak/), [Laureano Moro-Vel√°zquez](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/laureano-moro-velazquez/) and [Jes√∫s Villalba](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/jesus-villalba/).        

I graduated with Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E) program at JHU with the major of [Electrical Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/academics/masters-program/) and the concentration of [Human Language Technology](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/human-language-technology-masters/) in May, 2023. I worked on Speech Diagnosis for Parkinson‚Äôs Disease in [Prof. Najim Dehak‚Äôs lab](https://engineering.jhu.edu/najim/). 

I received the dual degrees: [Bachelor of Engineering (Research and Development) (Honours)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/program/aenrd) with the first class honours in [Electronic and Communication Systems](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/major/ELCO-MAJ) and [Bachelor of Science](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/program/bsc) in [Statistics](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/major/STAT-MAJ) from [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au/) in December, 2020.             

My research interests include speech processing and speech diagnosis. Feel free to contact me via email: <a href="mailto:tcao7@jhu.edu">tcao7@jhu.edu</a>.
