# üôã About me

I am an incoming Ph.D. student who will pursue a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in Electrical Engineering at JHU. I work at [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Najim Dehak](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/najim-dehak/), [Laureano Moro-Vel√°zquez](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/laureano-moro-velazquez/) and [Jes√∫s Villalba](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/jesus-villalba/).        

I graduated with Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E) program at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) with the major of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the concentration of Human Language Technology in May, 2023. I worked on Speech Diagnosis for Parkinson‚Äôs Disease in Prof. Najim Dehak‚Äôs lab. 

I received the dual degrees: Bachelor of Engineering (Research and Development) (Honours) with the first class honours in Electronic and communication systems and Bachelor of Science in Statistics from the Australian National University (ANU) in 2020.             

My research interests include speech processing and speech diagnosis. Feel free to contact me via email: <a href="mailto:tcao7@jhu.edu">tcao7@jhu.edu</a>.
