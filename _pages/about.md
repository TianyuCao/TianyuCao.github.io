# üôã About me

I am an incoming Ph.D. student who will pursue a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in Electrical Engineering at [The Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://www.jhu.edu/). I work at [Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) under the supervision of Prof. [Najim Dehak](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/najim-dehak/), [Laureano Moro-Vel√°zquez](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/laureano-moro-velazquez/) and [Jes√∫s Villalba](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/faculty/jesus-villalba/).        

I graduated with Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E) program at JHU with the major of [Electrical Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ece/academics/masters-program/) and the concentration of [Human Language Technology](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/human-language-technology-masters/) in May 2023. I worked on Speech Diagnosis for Parkinson‚Äôs Disease in [Prof. Najim Dehak‚Äôs lab](https://engineering.jhu.edu/najim/). 

I received the dual degrees: [Bachelor of Engineering (Research and Development) (Honours)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/program/aenrd) with the first class honours in [Electronic and Communication Systems](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/major/ELCO-MAJ) and [Bachelor of Science](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/program/bsc) in [Statistics](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2016/major/STAT-MAJ) from [The Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au/) in December 2020.             

My research interests include speech processing and speech diagnosis. Feel free to contact me via email: <a href="mailto:tcao7@jhu.edu">tcao7@jhu.edu</a>.

# üéñ Honors and Awards
- *2023/09*: **[Nicholas P. Jones Fellowship](https://engineering.jhu.edu/education/graduate-studies/full-time-graduate-fellowships-grants/)**:                  
  The Jones Fellowship is a donor-funded award that supports graduate financial aid. In particular, the Jones Fellowship's purpose is to provide financial aid support to graduate students of the Whiting School of Engineering. It was established by various donors to recognize Nicholas P. Jones' leadership and successes during his 25 years at JHU, including 9 years as Dean for the Whiting School of Engineering, in 2013.                     
  
- *2023/01*: **ECE Departmental Fellowship**:                  
  This competitive scholarship is awarded to a prospective ECE Ph.D. student who has shown exceptional promise. The primary purpose is to provide an incoming student with a broad set of interests the flexibility to work with multiple faculty members/lab groups in their first year. The Fellowship includes full 1st-year tuition, fees, and stipend support for 12 months. Incoming students cannot apply directly. Instead, it is a scholarship awarded to a particular student based on the recommendation of the ECE Department Faculty and chosen by the ECE Ph.D. Faculty Admissions Committee.
